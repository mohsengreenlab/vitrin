Create a modern, single-page, professional website for an IT services company. Tone: confident, helpful, and marketing-driven. Visuals: AI-generated business imagery (hero + section headers) that feels premium and tech-forward. No metrics or vanity stats.

Core requirements

Hero: Big headline “Pay only for what matters to you!” + short subhead about modular, bespoke solutions. Primary CTA “Get a Quote” + secondary “See Our Work”. Sticky top nav with smooth scroll.

Design: Clean, enterprise aesthetic; responsive; accessible; dark-on-light with accent color; generous whitespace; subtle gradients/dividers.

Motion: Fade-in on scroll for each section and card; smooth anchor scrolling; micro-interactions on hover.

Structure (sections):

Hero (AI image), CTAs

Why Modular? 3–4 concise benefits (custom-fit, faster delivery, budget control, future-ready)

Offerings (four pillars as below, shown as elegant cards/grids)

How We Work (Discover → Design → Build → Launch → Support)

Tech & Integrations (logos/stack list—no partner claims)

CTA + Contact (short form: name, email, message; note: “pay-as-you-go, no lock-ins”)

Footer (links, email, city, socials)
